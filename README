README FOR QTABLET

STATUS:

- Really, really immature and only few classes implemented. Doing PoC before anything real.
- Don't try this at home:)

BUILDING:

cd qtablet
qmake
make
make install

RUNNING on N8X0:

Copy the install directory as it is in to the device. Note that you must
have Qt properly installed in the device before you can run qtablet.

For example (using USB networking):
scp -r qtablet/install root@192.168.2.15:/opt/

Create ssh connection:
ssh root@192.168.2.15

Go to the install directory and run:
cd /opt/install
sh stop_services.sh
sh start_qtablet.sh 

And you should see lots of debug output on terminal and QTablet should appear
on the screen.

Directory structure:
gui     - Directory for graphical classes
core    - Directory for non-graphical classes for supporting gui and other 
          classes.

          framework for QTable. The Wall provides home screen and menu
