#               : of the ToolBar statements, the order of execution is 
#               : irrelevant. Applets can appear and disappear and the other
#               : toolbar contents will change their size accordingly.
#               : Note that only the application height becomes adjusted
#               : for the toolbar size. If an applet takes too much width
#               : you must adjust it (normally by invoking the application 
#               : with --geometry <width>).
