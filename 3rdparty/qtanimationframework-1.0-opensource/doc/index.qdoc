    	\section1 Description
	
            This component adds a convenient API to do animations in Qt. 
            Note that this solution is experimental and work in progress:
            No backwards compatibility (source nor binary) is provided.
        

	
    The Animation Framework lets you define, run and control animations,
    states and transitions. The foundation classes QtAnimation and
    QtAnimationGroup are used to scoreboard both simple and complex
    animations. A simple animation might change a widget's geometry from one
    rectangle to another, over the course of 2 seconds, using a linear easing
    curve. You can daisy-chain animations by adding them to a sequential
    QtAnimationGroup, a class that also gives you fine grained control over
    pauses and combinations of parallel and sequential subanimations.

    You can also define properties for your objects in states using QtState,
    add states to a QtStateGroup to manage exclusivity for your states, and
    define animated transitions between the states using QtTransition. The
    Animation Framework classes help maintain the necessary bookkeeping in
    order to provide animated forms and scenes.
